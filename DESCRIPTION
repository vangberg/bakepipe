Description: Bakepipe turns your script-based workflows into reproducible 
    pipelines. It's designed for scientists and analysts who use R and prefer 
    to keep their workflows in scripts, but need better management of file 
    dependencies. The package automatically determines script execution order 
    through static analysis of file_in() and file_out() calls.

Description: Turn script-based workflows into reproducible
  pipelines. Designed for scientists and analysts who use R and prefer
  to keep their workflows in scripts, but need better management of file
  dependencies. The package automatically determines script execution order
  through static analysis of file_in() and file_out() calls.

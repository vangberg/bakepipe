\title{Read state file for incremental builds}
\usage{
read_state()
}
\value{
List where each element represents a tracked file with:
\itemize{
\item{checksum: MD5 hash of file content}
\item{last_modified: File modification timestamp}
\item{status: "fresh" or "stale"}
}
}
\description{
Reads existing state and checks the status of tracked files by comparing
their current checksums with cached values. Only concerns itself with files
that are already tracked, not all possible files.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get state information for tracked files
state_obj <- read_state()

# Check if a specific script is stale
if (state_obj$"my_script.R"$status == "stale") {
  # Script needs to be re-run
}
}
}

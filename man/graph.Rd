\title{Create dependency graph from parsed script data}
\usage{
graph(parse_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{parse_data}{Named list from parse() function, where each element
represents a script with 'inputs' and 'outputs' character vectors.}
}
\value{
List containing:
\itemize{
\item{nodes: Character vector of all nodes (scripts and artifacts)}
\item{edges: Data frame with 'from' and 'to' columns representing edges}
\item{adjacency_list: Named list where each element contains downstream neighbors}
}
}
\description{
Builds a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) representing the dependencies between
scripts and data files. The graph is represented using an adjacency list for
efficient traversal operations.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Parse scripts and create dependency graph
parsed <- parse()
graph_obj <- graph(parsed)
}
}

\examples{
# Copy sample project to temp directory
temp_dir <- tempfile()
dir.create(temp_dir)
sample_proj <- system.file("extdata", "sample-project", package = "bakepipe")
file.copy(sample_proj, temp_dir, recursive = TRUE)

# Change to the sample project directory
old_wd <- getwd()
setwd(file.path(temp_dir, "sample-project"))

# Execute the pipeline
created_files <- run()

# The function returns paths of files that were created or updated
print(created_files)

# Restore working directory and clean up
setwd(old_wd)
